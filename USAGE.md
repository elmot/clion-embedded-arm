Purpose
===

The plugin supports two different, almost unrelated features:
 * Conversion STM32CubeMX projects to CLion-capable _cmake_ project
 * Downloading and debugging binaries onto MCU chips using [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/)

You can use only one the second parts, if you develop something unrelated to ST products.

You are doing everything at your own risk. Nor me, nor JetBrains, nor anybody else takes any 
responsibility in case of any direct or indirect damages or losses. 

Prerequisites
===
You will need following tolls being installed and configured:

 * Compatible hardware, virtually any of [STM32 development boards](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools.html)
 * [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/). The project tested against CLion 2017.3 EAP.
 * [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm) 
 * [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/)
 * **(Windows only)** ST-LINK/V2 driver. May be downloaded from 
 [st.com](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html) or just borrowed from OpenOCD binary distribution
 * [STM32CubeMX](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). After installation, do not forget
 to download MCU support library for your MCU. See _Help -> Install new libraries_ there.
 * **(Windows only)** [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

Project creation and conversion HowTo
===
 1. Run _STM32CubeMX_ and:
    1. Choose your hardware
    1. Configure it
    1. In project settings, select name and location for the project.
    1. In project settings, select **SW4STM32** as a toolchain.
    1. Click **Generate Code**. This will generate Eclipse-style project stub with libraries and sources. 
 1. Run _Clion_ and:
    1. Open the result folder of the previous step as a project. Ignore all the errors shown.
    1. Select **Tools -\> Update CMake project with STM32CubeMX project**. This will regenerate project files and reload _cmake_ configs.
    1. Go to **File -\> Settings...  -\> Build, Execution, Deployment -\> OpenOCD support** and configure all the 
    required tools locations and setting, including your board config file. If there is no suitable config among existing, 
    _OpenOCD_ predefined ones, write your own one and use that.

Now you can connect your board and start the run config. The code should be compiled and downloaded to the chip. 
Also you are able to debug your project using the same run config.

 
    
While code writing    
===
 * Put all your source and include files under _Src_ and _Inc_ folders, respectively. 
 * In files, generated by **STM32CubeMX** all your code lines should be placed between of 
`/* USER CODE BEGIN ??? */` and `/* USER CODE END ??? */` pseudo comments. **STM32CubeMX** keeps those pieces of 
code untouched during code regeneration.
 * Run **Update CMake project with STM32CubeMX project** everytime after running **STM32CubeMX** code regeneration.
 
 * _CMakeLists.txt_ is always regenerated during project update, so if you make changes to it, they all will be lost. 
 If you need to have _CMakeLists.txt_ changed (i.e. external libraries, FPU support etc.) please 
 change the template, _CMakeLists_template.txt_, and then update the project.
